## Section I: Introduction ##

It is the first day of class for the new school year. The camera fades into ALEX sitting at his/her desk in the front of the classroom. Looking around the classroom, ALEX realizes to his/her dismay that (s)he does not know a single other person.

ALEX: *Wow I don't know anyone else in this class...great. I really don't want a repeat of last year. Oh God that was so embarassing. Oh well, maybe this year will different. Ha! That's a wish. Seriously Alex, get it together. You know what, I actually have a good feeling about this. I'm going to be ok.*

## Section II: Break into Groups ##

MR. GARVEY: Ok class, it looks like everyone is here so let's begin. My name is Mr. Garvey, and I will be your teacher this year for AP Biology. Now I know you're all capable of succeeding in this class because you either took Honors Biology last year or received a recommendation from your previous teacher, so I expect big things from all of you.

ALEX: *Oh great, he already has high expectations for us. I can't wait until I inevitably let him down like I do for everyone else.*

<!-- chose 21 as realistic arbitrary number of students, can change in future -->
MR. GARVEY: One of my goals this year is to implement more collaborate work among my students. So to kick things off, I want everyone to form groups of three. There should be 21 of you total, so everyone must be in a group. Aaaand, go!
