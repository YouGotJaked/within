## Section I: Introduction ##

It is the first day of class for the new school year. The camera fades into ALEX sitting at his desk in the front of the classroom.

ALEX: *Hmmm I wonder if I know anyone in this class this year. I'll do a casual peek to check and see.*

Trigger waits until users looks to either side of peripherals. If 10s go by and user still has not looked around, one of optional dialogues below is chosen randomly and triggers on a loop until user looks around.

ALEX: *Just do it already, no one's paying attention to you anyway.*
ALEX: *Man up and get it over with. Stop being so soft.*
ALEX: *Pretend like you're looking at the clock or something. Be casual. Be cool.*
ALEX: *What are you waiting for, just DO IT.*
ALEX: *Ok I'm gunna stop thinking about it and actually do it...NOW. Ok NOW. Wait NOW. NOW...Wow I'm pathetic.*

Looking around the classroom, ALEX realizes to his dismay that he does not know a single other person. Give time delay of ~20s to give chance for user to look around and get familiar with environment.

ALEX: *Wow I don't know anyone else in this class...great. I really don't want a repeat of last year. Oh God that was so embarassing. I hope no one here remembers. Oh well, maybe this year will different. Ha! That's a wish. Seriously Alex, get it together. You know what, I actually have a good feeling about this. I'm going to be ok.*

## Section II: Break into Groups ##

MR. GARVEY: Ok class, it looks like everyone is here so let's begin. My name is Mr. Garvey, and I will be your teacher this year for AP Biology. Now I know you're all capable of succeeding in this class because you either took Honors Biology last year or received a recommendation from your previous teacher, so I expect big things from all of you.

ALEX: *Oh great, he already has high expectations for us. I can't wait until I inevitably let him down like I do for everyone else.*

<!-- chose 21 as realistic arbitrary number of students, can change in future to something else divisible by 3 -->
MR. GARVEY: One of my goals this year is to implement more collaborate work among my students. So to kick things off, I want everyone to form groups of three and say one interesting thing you did over the summer as well as what you are most looking forward to this year. There should be 21 of you total, so everyone must be in a group. Aaaand, go!

ALEX: *FUCK. I need to find a group to join right now. I don't care who it is, I just can't be left alone.*

ALEX frantically looks around classroom. When ALEX looks at other students, this triggers them to move farther away.

ALEX: *Shit, shit, shit. Everyone's already in a group. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. Ok, ok, ok. Ummmmmmmm what do I do, what do I do, what do I do. I don't know...*

## Section III: Forced into Group ##

MR. GARVEY scans around the room to check and see if all the students are in a group.

MR. GARVEY: Ok, is everyone in a group now? Oh wait. Hey Alex, you need to be in a group for this exercise. Hmm, let's see who only has a group of two... It looks like Finn and Lara need a third parter. Why don't you go ahead and join them?

FINN and LARA look at each other and move closer to ALEX. Their body language seems to indicate they are indifferent about ALEX joining their group.

ALEX: *Great. They don't want me in their group. NO ONE wants me in their group. I don't blame them. I'm so worthless anyway.*

## Section IV: Group Interaction ##

## Section V: Inner Monologue ##

After ALEX's initial interaction with the group, his thoughts start to spiral out of control. His thought process begins to exhibit both fliltering<sup>[1](#filtering)</sup> and catastrophizing<sup>[2](#catacatastrophizing)</sup>.

## Section VI: Anxiety Climax ##

## Section VII: Deep Breathing ##

## Section VIII: Ending ##
