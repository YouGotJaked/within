## Section I: Introduction ##

It is the first day of class for the new school year. The camera fades into ALEX sitting at his desk in the front of the classroom.

ALEX: *Hmmm I wonder if I know anyone in this class this year. I'll do a casual peek to check and see.*

Trigger waits until users looks to either side of peripherals. If 10s go by and user still has not looked around, one of optional dialogues below is chosen randomly and triggers on a loop until user looks around.

ALEX: *Just do it already, no one's paying attention to you anyway.*
ALEX: *Man up and get it over with. Stop being so soft.*
ALEX: *Pretend like you're looking at the clock or something. Be casual. Be cool.*
ALEX: *What are you waiting for, just DO IT.*
ALEX: *Ok I'm gunna stop thinking about it and actually do it...NOW. Ok NOW. Wait NOW. NOW...Wow I'm pathetic.*

Looking around the classroom, ALEX realizes to his dismay that he does not know a single other person. Give time delay of ~20s to give chance for user to look around and get familiar with environment.

ALEX: *Wow I don't know anyone else in this class...great. I really don't want a repeat of last year. Oh God that was so embarassing. I hope no one here remembers. Oh well, maybe this year will different. Ha! That's a wish. Seriously Alex, get it together. You know what, I actually have a good feeling about this. I'm going to be ok.*

## Section II: Break into Groups ##

MR. GARVEY: Ok class, it looks like everyone is here so let's begin. My name is Mr. Garvey, and I will be your teacher this year for AP Biology. Now I know you're all capable of succeeding in this class because you either took Honors Biology last year or received a recommendation from your previous teacher, so I expect big things from all of you.

ALEX: *Oh great, he already has high expectations for us. I can't wait until I inevitably let him down like I do for everyone else.*

MR. GARVEY: One of my goals this year is to implement more collaborate work among my students. So to kick things off, I want everyone to form groups of three and say one interesting thing you did over the summer as well as what you are most looking forward to this year. There should be 21<sup>[3](#students)</sup> of you total, so everyone must be in a group. Aaaand, go!

ALEX: *FUCK. I need to find a group to join right now. I don't care who it is, I just can't be left alone.*

ALEX frantically looks around classroom. When ALEX looks at other students, this triggers them to move farther away.

ALEX: *Shit, shit, shit. Everyone's already in a group. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. Ok, ok, ok. Ummmmmmmm what do I do, what do I do, what do I do. I don't know...*

## Section III: Forced into Group ##

MR. GARVEY scans around the room to check and see if all the students are in a group.

MR. GARVEY: Ok, is everyone in a group now? Oh wait. Hey Alex, you need to be in a group for this exercise. Hmm, let's see who only has a group of two... It looks like Finn and Lara need a third parter. Why don't you go ahead and join them?

FINN and LARA look at each other and move closer to ALEX. Their body language seems to indicate they are indifferent about ALEX joining their group.

ALEX: *Great. They don't want me in their group. NO ONE wants me in their group. I don't blame them. I'm so worthless anyway.*

## Section IV: Group Interaction ##

**NEED TO ADD THIS SECTION**

## Section V: Inner Monologue ##

After ALEX's initial interaction with the group, his thoughts start to spiral out of control. His thought process begins to exhibit both fliltering<sup>[4](#filtering)</sup> and catastrophizing<sup>[5](#catastrophizing)</sup>. ALEX's breathing and heart rate slowly increase in speed and volume.

ALEX: *Why does this always happen to me? Why am I not better? Why doesn't anyone like me?  Seriously, it hasn't even been five minutes and everyone already hates me. I bet Mr. Garvey is already annoyed with me too. He asked us to do one simple thing, and I couldn't even do that. I can't do anything right. That's probably why no one wanted me in their group. They don't wanna be associated with someone as undesirable as me.*

## Section VI: Anxiety Climax ##

ALEX's breathing is now very noticable, almost as if he is about to hyperventilate. His heart rate is racing so fast it seems his heart is going to jump out of his chest. His vision begins to blur<sup>[6](#blur)</sup> and lighting seems to be burning hot. Thoughts are racing through his head, and he cannot seem to control them.

ALEX: *SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP!*

**NEED TO ADD REST OF CLIMAX**

## Section VII: Deep Breathing ##

CLAIRE, a fellow student who has been struggling with GAD for some time now, notices Alex experiencing an anxiety attack.

CLAIRE: Hey there, everything is going to be ok. There is nothing to be afraid of. I know this feels very real to you right now, but please know that is this only temporary. I'm going to help you through this. I'll be right here by your side; I'm staying with you until this is over, ok? I promise there will be no judgement. I'm here only to support you.

ALEX is so overwhelmed that he cannot seem to speak, no matter how hard he tries. If ALEX is not looking at CLAIRE, the next dialogue is delayed ~10s to show that CLAIRE is not trying to rush the process and is willing to be patient.

CLAIRE: I want you to know that just because you can't verbalize the feelings causing your anxiety doesn't make them less valid. I too suffer from anxiety, and I think I have something that might help. Would you be willing to give it a shot? It's perfectly ok if you don't want to.

ALEX: Y-yeah ok. Let's try it.

CLAIRE: Perfect! So we're going to try a technique my counselor showed me called diaphragmatic breathing. It doesn't get rid of the anxiety all together, but it really helps me take the edge off and ride it out. So what you're going to want to do is put one hand on your chest and the other on your stomach, like this.

CLAIRE moves her hands to the diaphragmaetic breathing position.

CLAIRE: First take a slow breath in through your nose. Try to breathe into your lower belly. You should feel it expand a bit. Go ahead and try that and hold your breath for a second or two.

Give time delay of ~15s for user to assemble into position.

CLAIRE: You got it! Now exhale slowly through your mouth. Wait a few seconds, and then take another slow breath in through your nose.

Give another time delay of ~15s for user to attempt breathing technique.

CLAIRE: And that's all there is to it. Let's try it for about a minute and see how you feel after.

CLAIRE cycles through the steps several times, guiding ALEX through each step. Give a time delay of ~60s.

## Section VIII: Ending ##

CLAIRE: Yes that's exactly it! You're doing fantastic. I can already see a huge improvement. Oh hey, I don't think I ever got your name. Do you mind me asking what your name is?

ALEX: Alex.

CLAIRE: Alex! Well it is a pleasure to formally meet you. I'm Claire by the way.

School bell rings.

CLAIRE: Oh looks like I gotta run to my next class. But I'll see you around Alex?

MR. GARVEY: Ok class that's going to be for today. Be prepared to start talking about gene therapy next class. Have a great rest of your first day!

All of the students get up and head toward the door to leave to their class. ALEX remains seated in his chair.

MR. GARVEY: Oh hey Claire, could I talk to you briefly before you go? I'll write you a note to give to your next teacher so you don't get in trouble in case you're tardy.

CLAIRE: Of course Mr. Garvey.

CLAIRE gets up and walks to MR. GARVEY's desk.

MR. GARVEY: Hey listen Claire, I just really want to thank you for helping out with Alex today. I'm going to be honest, I really had no idea what was happening, so I wasn't sure how to handle the situation. But it looks like you knew exactly what to do.

CLAIRE: Thank you Mr. Garvey, I really appreciate it.

MR. GARVEY: Are you busy after school today? If not, do you think you could meet me here and walk me through the steps you took to make sure Alex was ok? If this happens to him or another student in the future, I want to make sure I can address the situation properly.

CLAIRE: I would love to! I will see you this afternoon at 3:00 sharp.

MR. GARVEY: Thank you Claire. I will see you then. Oh and don't forget this!

MR. GARVEY hands CLAIRE the note.

CAMERA fades to black.
